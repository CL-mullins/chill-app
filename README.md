# Chill

*“No more long lines”*

## Intro & Goal
Our goal is to make Chill the app paves a new way for safe shopping.  Others in this space focus on a pre-ordering/pickup model. Chill is a way for users to still enjoy in person shopping all while waiting from the comfort of their car.

## Who’s it for?

In-person shoppers - those who like to shop in person or want to quality control the product they intend to buy. This also fits those who stand in long lines for sales or for the hottest new thing for their child.
Retail stores - The pandemic has shown that retail stores need something to pivot on when they must limit who can enter their store at a given time.

## Why build it?

It’s something we personally enjoy using
It’s good to have a backup plan in case restrictions are put in place in the future.
Monetization opportunities in advertising and/or data
Usability


# What is it?

## Glossary

**Index View** - homepage of stores to stand in line
**Detailed View** - permalink page for each store
**Map View** - users create routes for all the stores they want to go to (login required)
**In-line View** - shows current wait time and line number
**Store-View** - shows count of people in the store by their id.


## User Types

**Non-Registered Users** - people that have no yet registered but can still stand in line for a store
**Registered Viewers** - people that have registered, these users can create routes(map feature) and favorite/subscribe to stores
**Retail Stores** - stores that are partnered with chill


### Index View
The Index View (ie, homepage) displays a list of stores.

When not signed in, a CTA must be presented to signup.  When signed up, a CTA to stand in line must be present.

Additionally, there should be a section with a list view of the store you’re currently waiting in line for. 

### Detailed View
The Detailed View (ie, permalink page) displays information about the store. CTA to browse their website must be present.

Additionally, this page should include how many people are ahead of you and an estimated time wait.

### Map View
Each post must contain:

**Name** - name of the product or service
**Tagline** - short (<60 character?) description of the product or service
**URL** - duh
**Submitted By** - person that submitted the post with their profile picture and/or name
**Votes** - number of votes for that post w/ profile pics of each user that voted
**Comments** - number of comments for that post (maybe with profile pics of those that commented)

After submitting a post, the user should be instructed to say something interesting, adding the first comment to spark conversation.


## Stores
Each store includes:

**Name** - Name of the store
**URL** - link to website (CTA eg. “ browse target’s deals while you wait”)
**Store hours** - how long is the store open


### Favorite/Subscription
Users can favorite/subscribe to stores.  This does not change the Index View (the feed of posts) but will be used to re-engage users when people they follow take actions like browse websites, or create routes.


### Post Notifications
Users receive the following post notifications:

When they are next in line - In app notification banner will pop up on screen or on phone when they are up to enter the store.
Map Re-engagement
After a user leaves the store, they will get a notification to open the app to get directions to the next store.
Registration
Every user must register getting the following information:

Name
email
Password

### Brainstormed Ideas





### Competitors & Product Inspiration




### Seeding Users & Content
Initial contributors will be hand-picked to create exclusivity and reduce potential spam.  Ideal contributors will be recognizable product people (e.g. Nir Eyal, Semil Shah, Hiten Shah) and investors (e.g. Josh Elman, Nick Chirls) in the startup space but may also include lesser known, early tech adopters.

To capture higher profile startup personalities like Hunter Walk we may submit product finds on his behalf with permission (e.g. based on something he’s tweeted).
